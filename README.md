I received this project as a take-home assignment and decided to use it as an opportunity to practice and learn new technologies. 

Unlike my previous React applications which were built using class components, this was built primarily using functional components and React Hooks. At first there was a little bit of a learning curve trying to figure out how to do things like ```componentDidMount()``` using ```useEffect()```. After adjusting, I quickly began to appreciate how much time I was able to save avoiding boilerplate code like 
```JavaScript
export default class CoolComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
      super(props)
      }
  }
 ```
